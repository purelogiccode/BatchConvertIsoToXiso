## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|:---|:---|
| **Windows 10/11, Linux, or macOS** (x64 or ARM64) | Avalonia application; builds and runs on all three platforms |
| **.NET 10 SDK** | Matches the `net10.0` target; `global.json` pins the required SDK version |
| **Git** | To clone the repository |

Verify your SDK:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

## Cloning

```bash
git clone https://github.com/purelogiccode/XISOStudio.git
cd XISOStudio
```

## Building

Build the full solution (application + test project):

```bash
dotnet build CSharp_XISOStudio.sln
```

Or build and run the application directly:

```bash
dotnet run --project XISOStudio
```

### Bundled Helper Tools

XISO conversion is performed by the `XISOSharp` NuGet package and CHD encoding by the `CHDSharp` NuGet package — no conversion binaries are bundled. The application project bundles the official 7-Zip console binaries, copied to the output directory for the matching platform/architecture:

- `7za.exe`, `7za_arm64.exe` — 7-Zip CLI fallback for Windows (x64/ARM64)
- `7zz_linux_x64`, `7zz_linux_arm64` — 7-Zip CLI fallback for Linux (static build)
- `7zz_osx` — 7-Zip CLI fallback for macOS (universal arm64/x86-64)

These are committed to the repository, so no extra download steps are needed. A system `7z` on `PATH` (for example `sudo apt install 7zip` or `brew install sevenzip`) is used as a further fallback; SharpCompress handles `.zip`/`.rar`/most `.7z` archives without any of them. The bundled binaries are distributed under the 7-Zip license (`7-Zip-License.txt`).

## Running the Tests

The test suite uses xUnit with Moq:

```bash
dotnet test CSharp_XISOStudio.sln
```

The suite covers models, services (orchestrator, XISO conversion, integrity, extractor, movers, path helpers, update checker, and more).

## Code Analysis

Both projects enforce analyzer rules (**Meziantou.Analyzer**, **Roslynator**) as build warnings. Treat new warnings in changed code as errors in practice — keep the build clean.

## Publishing a Release Build

Example for a framework-dependent x64 publish (single file, with the native Avalonia/Skia
libraries embedded and extracted to a temporary folder on first run):

```bash
dotnet publish XISOStudio -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
```

For a self-contained build (no .NET runtime requirement for end users):

```bash
dotnet publish XISOStudio -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

Supported runtime identifiers:

| Platform | RIDs |
|:---|:---|
| Windows | `win-x64`, `win-arm64` |
| Linux | `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64` |
| macOS | `osx-x64`, `osx-arm64` |

All RIDs can be cross-published from any OS (the native Avalonia/Skia assets come from NuGet). After extracting a Linux/macOS build, mark the executable runnable with `chmod +x XISOStudio`.

## Project Notes

- **Target framework:** `net10.0` with **Avalonia** (`Avalonia`, `Avalonia.Desktop`, `Avalonia.Themes.Fluent`, `Avalonia.Controls.DataGrid`).
- **Nullable + implicit usings** are enabled.
- The `References/` folder (vendored sources such as the xdvdfs Rust workspace, if present) is excluded from compilation.
- Version numbers are maintained in `XISOStudio.csproj` (`AssemblyVersion` / `FileVersion`); the update checker compares against GitHub release tags.
- Windows-only features degrade gracefully on Linux/macOS: the disk read/write speed monitor shows `N/A`, and the 7-Zip CLI fallback ships bundled for every platform (with a system `7z` as a further fallback).
